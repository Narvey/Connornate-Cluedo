This is our Clue game project for CSCI 306 
========================================
By its completion, this project will have a fully-functional game of Clue 
(aka Cluedo) that can be played against the computer.  

This program expects a board.csv file with the board layout (see example) 
and a legend.csv file which explains the room abbreviations used in the 
layout. 
 
Log: 
1. First commits have the board layout. 
2. Subsequent commits have the failing tests version. 
3. Now we are to the point of Passing Tests with respect to targets
